# BrainFuck
## Credits Due
This interpreter was created by me, and it uses intuitive techniques to combat certain challenges, like loops, where I used loop-stacking instead of preprocessing.

## How To Use This BrainFuck Python Interpreter

### The Python interpreter has 2 modes, and they are as follows:
1. Shell: To initialize shell mode, do not run the Python file with another file; rather, open it normally/by itself. For communication purposes, the file can be run by other shell scripting languages, such as, but not limited to, Windows Batch/CMD and Microsoft/Windows PowerShell.
2. File: To initialize file mode, you must run the Python file with the .bf file, whether through CMD or simply drag and drop (I am not sure if drag and drop works in this case). Ex. (in CMD) "python brainfuck.py file.bf"

### Updates/Status
- The Linux version is currently being developed and will be added soon.
- The JavaScript for the web version is currently in development
