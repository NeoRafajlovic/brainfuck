## How To Use BrainFuck Python Interpreter

This interpreter has 2 mode and are as follows:
1. Shell: To initialize shell mode, do not run python file with another file, rather open it normally/by itself. For communication purposes, the file can be ran by other shell scripting languages such as, but is not limited to, Windows Batch/CMD, Microsoft/Windows PowerShell.
2. File: To initialize file mode, you must run the python file with the .bf file, whether through CMD, or simply drag and drop (I am not sure if drag and drop works in this case). Ex. (In CMD) python brainfuck.py file.bf
